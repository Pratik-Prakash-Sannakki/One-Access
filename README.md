# Problem Statement:

With the current healthcare system being manual/semi automated and advancement in technology and virtualisation, lack of an automated system becomes a boon if not necessity for ease and a seamless experience.

This application provides users a platform where they may buy the essential goods and services, simplifying their lives without exposing them to the continued spread of diseases and saving them a significant amount of time.
